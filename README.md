# Road to Marching Cubes

## Overview
This repository documents my journey toward understanding and implementing the Marching Cubes algorithm. Marching Cubes is a widely used algorithm for generating isosurfaces from volumetric data, often applied in medical imaging and computer graphics. Through this process, I explore the foundational concepts and gradually build up the knowledge necessary to implement the algorithm from scratch.

The goal of this project is not only to implement Marching Cubes but also to gain a deeper understanding of its applications, mathematical foundations, and performance optimizations.

## Journey
It started with basic understanding of the marching cube algorithm and implementating some variations of it. After that I found out about the computing shader and computing buffer idea, helping out with optimization of the big computations marching cubes will have (Putting CPU calculations on the GPU).
