Road to Marching Cubes
Overview
This repository documents my journey toward understanding and implementing the Marching Cubes algorithm. Marching Cubes is a widely used algorithm for generating isosurfaces from volumetric data, often applied in medical imaging and computer graphics. Through this process, I explore the foundational concepts and gradually build up the knowledge necessary to implement the algorithm from scratch.

The goal of this project is not only to implement Marching Cubes but also to gain a deeper understanding of its applications, mathematical foundations, and performance optimizations.
